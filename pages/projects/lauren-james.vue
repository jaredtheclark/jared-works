      <h3>Lauren James is a women’s retailer that sells preppy dresses and printed tees. I joined the Lauren James team in 2017 and am now working as the Product Manager of the ecommerce channel. </h3>
      <p>When I originally joined the team, the ecommerce channel was in need of basic front-end optimizations and the ui design needed some tender love & care. Most pages loaded very slowly since most of the site’s functionality relied on external javscript libraries. My goals when I joined the team were to optimize site performance, update the ui, and improve the cart funnel experience.</p>

      <p class="smallParagraph">Like the navigation, the old homepage design presented almost every available option to users, this cognitive overhead load prevented users from easily determining how they should proceed forward. </p>
      <p class="smallParagraph">The reorganized header featured tiered product navigation with the second level options displayed as dropdowns on desktop, and as a sliding hamburger navigation on mobile.</p>

      <h3>The ui of the site was outdated and needed improvement, so we began on the ui.</h3>
      <p>Our team first began updating the design by designing landing pages for the new features we were building, and facilitated marketing efforts. After designing a few pages for different sales and features, it became apparent to our team that we needed a way to keep our styles consistent and organized, enter the laurenjames.com design system.</p>
